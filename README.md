# Kotlin Code Examples

Welcome to the Kotlin Code Examples repository! This collection showcases various fundamental Kotlin programming concepts through simple, standalone code snippets. Each example is designed to illustrate a specific feature of Kotlin, making it easier to learn and understand the language.

## Overview of Code Snippets

1. **Basic Variable Operations**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how to declare and use mutable (`var`) and immutable (`val`) variables in Kotlin. Shows basic operations such as assignment and printing values.
   - **Example**: Shows how to reassign a mutable variable and print both mutable and immutable variable values.

2. **Class Definition and Method Usage**
   - **Description**: Illustrates how to define a class with properties and methods. Demonstrates creating an instance of the class and calling its method.
   - **Example**: Defines a `Person` class with a method that prints a property value.

3. **String Interpolation**
   - **Description**: Shows how to use Kotlin's string interpolation to include variable values and expressions within strings.
   - **Example**: Formats and prints a string that includes the sum of two numbers.

4. **Character and Escape Sequences**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates handling characters and special symbols in Kotlin, including how to print characters and escape sequences like newlines and backslashes.
   - **Example**: Prints a character, a dollar sign, and a backslash using escape sequences.

5. **Multi-line Strings (Unindented)**
   - **Description**: Shows how to define and work with multi-line strings without any additional indentation.
   - **Example**: Prints a multi-line string where new lines are preserved as written.

6. **Multi-line Strings (Indented)**
   - **Description**: Illustrates how to handle multi-line strings with indentation, showing how leading spaces are preserved.
   - **Example**: Prints a multi-line string with indentation that is part of the string content.

7. **Multi-line Strings (Mixed Indentation)**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how mixed levels of indentation in multi-line strings affect the output.
   - **Example**: Shows how different indentation levels within a multi-line string are preserved.

8. **Arrays (Creation and Modification)**
   - **Description**: Shows how to create, modify, and access elements in arrays. Includes examples of single-dimensional arrays and array manipulation.
   - **Example**: Creates arrays of integers and strings, modifies elements, and prints the results.

9. **Array Iteration**
   - **Description**: Demonstrates how to iterate over arrays using `for` loops and print each element.
   - **Example**: Iterates over arrays of integers and strings, printing each element.

10. **Multi-dimensional Arrays (Matrices)**
    - **Description**: Illustrates the use of multi-dimensional arrays (matrices) and how to access specific elements.
    - **Example**: Defines a 2D array (matrix) and prints an element from it.

11. **Type Conversion**
    - **Description**: Demonstrates converting between different data types, such as converting an `Int` to a `Long`.
    - **Example**: Converts an integer value to a long and prints the result.

12. **Type Casting**
    - **Description**: Shows unsafe and safe type casting techniques in Kotlin. Demonstrates how to cast objects and handle potential casting issues.
    - **Example**: Performs both unsafe and safe casting and handles casting results.
